There are some software systems like “subversion” on the market to manage multiple versions of files. But this kind of software cannot handle arbitrary large files. Accordingly, users need an improved software system to archive their different versions of files.

The proposed software system is a customized “Archiver” application, which works with a remote data repository – Mongo DB persistence engine which can run locally or on another machine. The Archiver that holds the files need to be archived. In addition, it can work with files through internet access.

The Archiver program allows users to manage multiple versions of selected files efficiently, only recording the parts that are changed between various versions. It has operations on files including adding new file to system, saving current version if updated, setting a selected version as reference, retrieving selected version’s detailed information and showing a selected version’s comment.
